                <p>Several years ago, a boy named Nata was discovered near the border of the Forbidden Lands, an
                    uncharted
                    region believed by the Guild to be uninhabited.Nata recounts how his village was attacked by a
                    mysterious monster. In response, the Guild has organized an expedition to investigate.The Hunter is
                    assigned to one of the units tasked with investigating the "White Wraith" and rescuing Nata's people
                    known as the Keepers.</p>

            <h2>The Apex</h2>
            <p>Apex Monsters are a unique categorization in Monster Hunter Wilds. While the title itself doesn't
                translate to anything necessarily special, it does denote the increased difficulty and thereby increased
                loot of these monsters. We'll tell you which are the apex monsters of which regions and exactly what
                that means here.</p>
            <p>These monsters will be naturally encountered through the story and are a bit harder than your average
                monster. However, they appear quite frequently in the end game and can appear as their Tempered variants
                just like any other monster.</p>
            <p>The most important thing to keep in mind about the Apex Monsters is that they generally have better
                equipment than other monsters, excluding some end-game monsters. They also inhabit a unique Rarity 6
                slot when they're encountered as Tempered Monsters, allowing them to drop the elusive Hunter's Symbol
                III.</p>

                        Udra is
                        covered in oilsilt, but when enraged it will ignite the coating, transfiguring itself into a

                        of
                        flame. The oculi that appear on its body and many arms are presumed to be sensory organs, but
                        the
                        truth is

                        to
                        the
                        Sandtide – when it most frequently appears – and is able to store, amplify, and discharge the
                        storm’s heavy
                        lightning to lethal effect. Rey Dau is highly territorial and will attack any and all intruders
                        on
                        sight.
                        The Fulgurite against its carapace emits a sound that puts every monster in the region on guard.

                        massive form
                        in cold temperatures via ridge-like cooling organs across its body: the frost its limbs produce
                        doubles as a
                        potent weapon and a way to travel along walls and floating rocks.</p>
