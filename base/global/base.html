            <h2>The Apex</h2>
            <p>Apex Monsters are a unique categorization in Monster Hunter Wilds. While the title itself doesn't translate to anything necessarily special, it does denote the increased difficulty and thereby increased loot of these monsters. We'll tell you which are the apex monsters of which regions and exactly what that means here.</p>
            <p>These monsters will be naturally encountered through the story and are a bit harder than your average monster. However, they appear quite frequently in the end game and can appear as their Tempered variants just like any other monster.</p>
            <p>The most important thing to keep in mind about the Apex Monsters is that they generally have better equipment than other monsters, excluding some end-game monsters. They also inhabit a unique Rarity 6 slot when they're encountered as Tempered Monsters, allowing them to drop the elusive Hunter's Symbol III.</p>

                    <h3>Nu Udra</h3>
                    <p>The cephalopod that reigns supreme over Oilwell Basin’s ecosystem. Usually, when sighted, Nu Udra is covered in oilsilt, but when enraged it will ignite the coating, transfiguring itself into a horror of flame. The oculi that appear on its body and many arms are presumed to be sensory organs, but the truth is still being investigated.</p>

                    <h3>Rey Dau</h3>
                    <p>The flying wyvern that reigns supreme over the Windward Plains’ ecosystem. It has adapted to the Sandtide – when it most frequently appears – and is able to store, amplify, and discharge the storm’s heavy lightning to lethal effect. Rey Dau is highly territorial and will attack any and all intruders on sight. The Fulgurite against its carapace emits a sound that puts every monster in the region on guard</p>

                    <p>A leviathan that sits at the peak of the Iceshard Cliff's ecosystem. It surrounds its massive form in cold temperatures via ridge-like cooling organs across its body: the frost its limbs produce doubles as a potent weapon and a way to travel along walls and floating rocks.</p>
